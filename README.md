# MINDS TOGETHER

Minds Together is a warm and safe place to go for advise on how to cope easier with mental health. Minds Together has been developed as part of Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp as my 1st ever project. This project is made by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Mental Health is a subject that is close to my heart so it was a pleasure to cover this topic for my first project.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Minds Together Palette](<docs/Minds-Together-Palette.png>)

I chose this colour palette as I found the colours were calming. I took each colour from my hero image.


### Typography

I chose the font Roboto as I found it to be an informative yet friendly font. It is also an accessibly friendly font. The weights i included are 400,500,600 and 700 for the variety of different sized headers.

![Roboto font](docs/Roboto-font.png)

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import my fonts.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

I made my wireframes using Balsamiq.

## Features

My site is made up of the Home page, the Get Help page and the How To Cope page.

### General features on each page

General features that reoccur on each page are the navbar, footer, favicon,

### Future Implementations


### Accessibility

In my project I have added aria-labels and names to all my links and buttons to enable screen readers to understand each element. I have run a lighthouse test and a wave test to ensure I have met the requirements needed to be accessible friendly.



## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

* Balsamiq - To create the wireframes
* Git - For version control
* Github - To save and store my project
* Bootstrap 4.6 - The framework for my project, this was used for my header, the modal and the cards.
* Google Fonts - For importing the font used in my project
* Font Awesome - For the icons for my social media links and my burger icon for the mobile menu
* Google Dev Tools - To troubleshoot and test features, solve issues with responsiveness and styling.
* Am I Responsive - To gather Images for my README that display on different devices.
* 
Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Github Pages was used to deploy the live website. The instructions to achieve this are below:

* Log in (or sign up) to Github.
* Find the repository for this project, Bully-Book-Club.
* Click on the Settings link.
* Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
* In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
* Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing


  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Content for the website was created by me with some assistance from [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/)

###  Media

The Images from my site were all taken from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) except the main hero image which was generated using [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/inspire/images?ff_channel=adobe_com&ff_campaign=ffly_homepage&ff_source=firefly_seo).

I converted my images to WEBP using [Pixelied](https://pixelied.com/convert/png-converter/png-to-webp)
